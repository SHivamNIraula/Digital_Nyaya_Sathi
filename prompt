here in this project I have created a virtual env called "DNS_env" and project name as "d_n_s". now  
 add a new Django app called "authentication" for login,logout, and register. Also create another  
 Django app called "home_page" where we get out main project dashboard page. But before showing the  
 dashboard I want to showcase the feature of this project one by one. For example, when we complete  
 out authentication then we should navigate to home_page app where user first see one feature of
this project and also there will be continue button which help to showcase another feature of the  
 project one by one. After showing all the features of this project then finally we will get to see  
 the dashboard page.[note: make the transition from one feature to another smooth and professional].
